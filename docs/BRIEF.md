### Take-home assignment (Step 1 of the process)

Please complete a take-home assignment. You are allowed to use LLMs to write code. To ensure that your work will not be used at Fluence, we’ve made it unrelated to healthcare:

**Build “LendLoop”: a neighborhood tool-lending board with automated workflows**

A simple app where neighbors list tools they are willing to lend, request to borrow from each other, and receive automated notifications and reminders handled by n8n.

#### Stack

- **Next.js (App Router)**
- **Clerk** for authentication
- **Convex** for data + backend logic
- **n8n** (self-hosted via Docker or n8n Cloud) for workflow automation
- **TypeScript**

#### Requirements

**Public page**

- The fictional company name is **LendLoop**.
- Short tagline, e.g. “Borrow what you need. Lend what you don’t.”
- Show:
  - A read-only list of available tools (name and category only, no owner details), pulled from Convex.
  - A **“Sign in to lend or borrow”** button wired to Clerk.

**Authenticated experience**

- Only signed-in users can:
  - List a tool with:
    - name
    - category (power tools, garden, kitchen, camping, etc.)
    - condition
    - short description
  - Request to borrow a tool for a date range.
  - Approve or decline requests on their own tools.
  - Mark a loan as returned.
- Show:
  - All tools with availability status, filterable by category.
  - “My listings”, “My requests”, and “Incoming requests” views.
  - Nice, minimal layout.

**Roles & rules**

- Have two roles:
  - **admin**:
    - Can remove any listing, view all loans, and mark a lender as “Trusted Lender”.
  - **user**:
    - Can create, edit, and delete only their own listings, and act only on requests involving their own tools or their own borrowing.
- Implement the above role-based access control with best practices, enforced in Convex functions, not only in the UI.

**Automation with n8n**

- Build at least two n8n workflows:
  - **Request notification:** when a borrow request is created or changes status, Convex calls an n8n Webhook. The workflow notifies the relevant user (email, Slack, Discord, or a logged mock notification is fine) using only the fields it needs.
  - **Overdue reminders:** a scheduled workflow runs daily, fetches overdue loans from a Convex HTTP endpoint, sends a reminder to each borrower, and writes the reminder status back to Convex.
- Secure the integration in both directions:
  - Sign webhook payloads (e.g. HMAC with a shared secret) and verify signatures on the receiving side.
  - Keep secrets in environment variables and n8n credentials, never in code or exported workflow JSON.
  - Make write-backs idempotent so retries do not create duplicate records or reminders.
  - Handle failures with retries and an error workflow (or equivalent) so failed runs are visible and never fail silently.
- (Bonus) Show recent automation activity on each loan in the app, e.g. “Reminder sent 2 days ago”.

#### Deliverables

- A GitHub repository with the app source code.
- Exported n8n workflow JSON files in the repository.
- A README covering local setup (including n8n, e.g. a docker-compose file), environment variables, architecture, and your security and data-minimization decisions.
- A short note on what you would change to run this in production.

**We evaluate:**

- Code structure and clarity
- Security-minded thinking
- UX and practicality
- Integration design, reliability, and error handling (n8n)
- Documentation and reasoning
